# Maze Solver

## Overview
This program is a **C++ implementation of a maze-solving system** that uses a custom queue data structure to explore paths through a dynamically allocated maze.  
It reads maze data, represents locations within the maze, and systematically processes positions to determine valid traversal paths, with testing handled through dedicated test files.

The project emphasizes **data structure implementation, dynamic memory management, modular design, and algorithmic problem-solving**, and includes a `Makefile` to streamline compilation and ensure consistent builds across environments.

## Features
- Custom queue data structure implementation
- Dynamic maze representation using allocated memory
- Location-based traversal through the maze
- Systematic exploration of valid paths
- Separation of maze logic and queue logic into modules
- Dedicated test files for validating queue and maze behavior
